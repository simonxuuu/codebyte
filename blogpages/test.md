Hello everyone! First of all, we want to thank you for using edCode. It truly means a lot to us, and we are striving to make the edCode experience better every day.

Thanks to our launch on Product Hunt, we were able to get from ~30 users to now 350!! We also got #2 education product of the week, all thanks to your support.

We hope to keep this community growing, so if you'd like to see anything added, feel free to give us some feedback on your dashboard or [here](https://edcodee.me/feedback). We want to be able to create as many high-quality courses as we can, so we are in the process of growing our small team (if you'd like to join, head over to [our open positions](https://edcodee.me/positions))

That being said, let's get into what we added.

# Usernames
Custom usernames! Now you don't have to stick with the default randomly generated username. We also added more variety to the randomly generated usernames.
