Hello everyone! First of all, we want to thank you for using edCode. It truly means a lot to us, and we are striving to make the edCode experience better every day.

Thanks to our launch on Product Hunt, we were able to get from ~30 users to now 500!! We also got #2 education product of the week, all thanks to your support.

We hope to keep this community growing, so if you'd like to see anything added, feel free to give us some feedback on your dashboard or [here](https://edcodee.me/feedback). We want to be able to create as many high-quality courses as we can, so we are in the process of growing our small team (if you'd like to join, head over to [our open positions](https://edcodee.me/positions))

That being said, let's get into what we added.


# Blog Posts
We made this blog, which will have weekly or biweekly updates on development, as well as helpful information. 

# Usernames
Custom usernames! Now you don't have to stick with the default randomly generated username. We also added more variety to the randomly generated usernames.

# Bug fixes / Quality of Life
In this update we've fixed over 20 bugs, and added a ton of quality of life changes, namely single-sign-on with Google. 
We are actively working on implementing the feedback that you all submitted on the feedback tab (code visualization coming soon).
Additionally, if you can find 5+ bugs and report them on the feedback tab, we will add you to our list of potential hires for our QA Engineer role.
# What's next?
## Friends, More courses, Challenges, Codey Preview, New Question Types
In the next update, we will be introducing a friend system, 1-2 new courses, daily and weekly challenges, an early version of Codey, as well as much needed new question types. We will also be adding a code visualizer, making it much easier to view how the code is actually structured. 
As for the next courses, we are open to your feedback on what will be added next. Send us a message over at our LinkedIn page, or on the feedback page located on your dashboard.


Happy Edcoding.
